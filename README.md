This is companion code to the book [Craft GraphQL APIs in Elixir with Absinthe](https://pragprog.com/titles/wwgraphql/craft-graphql-apis-in-elixir-with-absinthe/). It includes some endpoints and views for a GraphQL API for a hypothetical restaurant.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create a `.env` and run `source .env`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
